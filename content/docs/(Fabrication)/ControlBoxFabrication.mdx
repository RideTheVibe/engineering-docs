title: Control Box Fabrication
---


The control box is fabricated using precision-cut sheet metal, given the structural rigidity and manufacturing repeatability this method offers.
The design is optimized for CNC laser cutting and CNC press brake bending. All bend reliefs, hole diameters, and tab geometries are modeled with common sheet-metal fabrication service's design tolerances.

## Flat Pattern

To have the control box manufactured, please upload the flat pattern to the sheet metal fabrication service of your choice, the DXF file contains the cut lines as well as the bend lines needed.
