| **Steel Tube Bending**      | 1 inch tube with 3" CLR bending die        | Local metal fabrication or tubing shops. From my research, custom car muffler fabrication shops have reasonable prices for this service.                                  |
| **MIG Welding**             | For frame joints and structural assembly  | Welding and fabrication services                                           |
| **Sheet Metal Cutting/Bending** | Used for control box enclosure       | [SendCutSend](https://www.sendcutsend.com)                                 |
| **3D Printing** | For electronics enclosures | Local makerspaces or 3D printing bureaus                                   |


### Parametric CAD Design

The mechanical design of the Vibe was digitally produced in Fusion 360 CAD software, (see fusion file in [downloadables](/docs/AllDownloadables)).
To help build a scalable design that is easily customizable for different sizes of dropout distances/axle sizes and/or seat heights, the modelling in Fusion was done with parametric design in mind.
Here are some of the available parameters that can be edited to produce frames of different sizes:

To access/modify these parameters, look under `(Design Workspace) -> Solid -> Modify -> Change Parameters`
